"""Step 1: RegEx Extraction (30 points)
1.Create patterns to extract:
1.1.Hashtags: #python, #AI, #MachineLearning
1.2.Mentions: @username, @company
1.3.URLs: http/https links
1.4.Emojis: Unicode emoji patterns
1.5.Numbers: Follower counts, likes, retweets

Step 2: NLTK Analysis (40 points)
2.Implement:
2.1.Tokenization: Split posts into words and sentences
2.2.Sentiment scoring: Classify as positive, negative, or neutral
2.3.Keyword extraction: Find most common meaningful words
